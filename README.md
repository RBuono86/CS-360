# CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application I designed was Option 1, the Inventory app, it was designed to authenticate the user by a password and email. After the user signed in, they were able to enable SMS. They were able to add, remove, increase, decrease items items addded into a SQLite Database. The application can send an alert to the user by SMS if the quantity reasches 0 and the in app indicator turned red. Finally the layout was set up as a Grid view per rubric.
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application uses four screens including a login, gride view display of inventory, setting and notification, and an add items flow. To keep UI development clean for the user, I kept the screens in a variety of colors of greens, purples, and blues to stay within the theme of the app. 
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I had many experiences before that brought ambitious thoughts into designing this application to life for this class. Even though it was simple but unqiue, I wanted it to be mine. I wanted it to be easy for someone to pick up and was able to use if it ever went into production.
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure that my code was function and running I tested on different emulated devices in the Android IDK with different screen sizes such as different pixel devices and different tables. I test my code over 100 times and debug all the time, every time you add a new feature to make sure you don't "break" your code.
# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
It is known for me not to have many challenges, but when I did see a challenge I overcame it by taking a look back and seeing if I could solve it within 30 min. If I didn't I got up and walked away and came back with fresh eyes and I saw it right away.
# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I enjoyed creating the log in authentication screen. Iâ€™ve enjoyed the most working with SQL and its different flavors such as mySQL and noSQL and look forward to pairing different programming languages with database integration. Next, I think everyone liked my icons I used for the interface for adding items as it made it more unique to the user. MY buttons were so easy to see and use.
